Grounding notes (internal): Loan/Mortgage processing is a first‑class Apps‑That‑Matter scenario, and Foundry now provides hosted agents with open‑protocol support (incl. MCP) and built‑in evals/guardrails. Copilot Studio agents surface in Teams/M365 Copilot Chat, can be shared/published via the org catalog, and connect to SharePoint/Dataverse/Graph connectors. Agent identity/governance is evolving via Agent 365.
